roles:
  intro: I worked on pelvina for about 3 years. As usual in a startup setting I took on several roles. In a product team consisting of product manager, product owner, marketing manager, data scientist as well as fullstack and frontend developers, my main focus was on design and its implementation.
  role:
    - name: UX/UI Designer
      text: Initially, I supported the creation of the course concept in close cooperation with a product developer. My initial focus was on the information architecture for the course content, the development of user flows, a first style guide and interface design for the app.
    - name: Design Lead
      text: |
        I took over the project lead of the redesign and design development, the coordination with the product manager and coordination of a visual designer by means of briefings and continuous feedback. Finally, I led a team of two in the design of completely new features and interface improvements.
    - name: UI Developer
      text: To be able to implement the design efficiently I developed a CSS architecture based on modular components and utility classes. This way I was able to implement the design quickly and consistently in a living style guide and later transfer it directly into the live product.

          This document was used to document the content structure of the app and to communicate with involved actors.
          
          The challenge was to transfer the contents and methods of a common prevention course with personal participation into a digital form. The course structure and required interaction possibilities in the course are regulated by legal provisions.

        text: |
          Process of how users access the module content. Based on this a first screen flow for a prototype to test the inner logic.
          
          The core of the course are the modules. Their implementation must be simple, straightforward and comprehensible. To be reimbursed, users must have consumed all content. The app supports them in doing so.

      - heading: Low-fidelity wireframes with realistic content for an interactive prototype
        text: |
          Once the core functions, course structure and initial content were defined, this prototype was used to further test the concept. All essential parts of the app are included.

          This prototype formed the basis for communication with product management and software developers and created a common understanding of the product vision.

      - heading: Introduction and addressing the users
        text: |
          For the heterogeneous target group, a design language had to be developed that did justice to the medical context and quality requirements as well as the sensitivity of the topic (pelvic floor and bladder weakness).

      - heading: Course modules and their structure
        text: |
          Each module and the assigned content was marked with its own color. The consistently clear design of the navigation elements should make it easier to access the various content levels.

      - heading: "Course contents: exercises, knowledge and quizzes"
        text: |
          Consumable content is displayed as a stack of cards. Once the content is completed on a card, the card disappears. The further the progress, the fewer cards – in addition to a classic progress bar, information about the current position in the content is thus constantly provided.

      - heading: Interface design directly implemented as living style guide
        text: |
          After first design explorations in Sketch, I documented the interface design directly in the app code and developed it further using "Design in the Browser". This procedure enabled us to quickly develop the actual product - without investing too much time in static design documents.

      - heading: Brighter, warmer, friendlier
        text: |
          After the course proved its marketability, we have further developed the design language of pelvina. 
          
          My original, functional design should evolve along with the brand to better align with pelvina's target audiences. The pelvina brand was to have a friendlier appearance, appeal personally and emotionally to the mainly female target group.

            image_alt: Three device mockups that present how we changed the look and feel of pelvina during the redesign.
            image_caption: We introduced friendly hand drawn illustrations to create emotional connection and support the textual message on the screens.
      - heading: New interface, same interaction design
        text: |
          While retaining the functional structures and elements, we have defined a large part of the look and feel that still essentially defines the visual brand identity of pelvina today: a friendly and warm color palette, coupled with soft gradients and organic shapes. Enriched with beautiful illustrations that appeal to the target group emotionally.

      - heading: Design Lead
        text: |
          I took over the project management and coordination with the product manager. Julia Körner, visual designer and illustrator, supported us in this project. I was her primary contact person and supported her as a with briefings, direction and continuous feedback.

  - title: Redesign of the course's discussion board
    contents:
      - heading: The starting point
        text: |
          The course forum for pelvina users came back into focus after user tests and looking at analytics. It turned out that the forums were used more frequently than anticipated but on the other hand they were not inviting to explore. The appearance was too homogeneous and a bit dull compared to other parts of the app. The connection to the course content was not always obvious.
      - heading: After the redesign
        text: |
          I removed the often repeated buttons for opening the forum pages, as the cards themselves were perceived as the interactive element to engage with content — the actual buttons were rarely tapped during user tests.
          
          I also applied the updated app's colour palette (which we evolved a bit further to become a bit warmer once again) and gray backgrounds have been replaced by tints of our pelvina rose.
          
          The reused illustrations from the course modules act as a visual reference to the associated content areas. They also catered for a more varied overall picture that users rated as more interesting and inviting.

            image_alt: A comparison of the before and after states where the updated forum design is more vibrant and friendly compared to the old version.
            image_caption: Before the redesign, grey was a dominant color which made for a rather dull appearance. With the module illustrations in place and updated colors the forums became a again a place where users like to read and share again.
      - heading: pelvina's Presence on the Web
        text: |
          Every digital product needs a marketing website that enables users and business partners to find out about the product.
          
          In cooperation with product management and marketing I developed a responsive, mobile-first website that fulfils this purpose. Based on the design language of the app, I created layouts and typography appropriate to the medium. The interactive reimbursement calculator allows interested parties to find out how much their health insurance company reimburses the course fees.

            image_caption: These screenshots show the third major version of the website where I used the design language that I developed together with Julia Körner.
  - title: Promotion of user feedback and App Store ratings
    contents:
      - heading: Getting regular user feedback and good ratings
        text: |
          The aim was to obtain user feedback in a discreet way with reference to important KPIs. Furthermore. Users should be encouraged to give ratings in the App Stores.

          The concept combines both goals. Various questions about the user experience are asked at key points in the User Journey e.g after completing the first course module. If users signal dissatisfaction, they are asked for feedback. If they are satisfied, they are asked for a rating in the respective App Store.
          
          This gives users the opportunity to express their frustration as feedback directly to us — before they do this in the form of a negative rating or review in the App Store.
          
          On the other hand, users with a positive attitude towards the app are more inclined to leave a positive rating. So we offer them a concrete hint and direct link to the App Store to encourages this behavior.
          
          After the feature was implemented, **the number of reviews in the App Store increased by about 30% within a couple of weeks.**

            image_alt: The image shows high-fidelity mockups of screens where users get a prompt to answer a question related to their experince.
            image_caption: Depending on the user's answer they're led to different screens which either promote a rating in the appstore or leave some feedback directly in the app. Undecided users aren't bothered anymore but are informed about the in-app chat where they can always leave feedback.
      - heading: Alternative answer options
        text: |
          We explored a few variations for the answer options. Initially each question had it's own set of answers and scales ranging from "yes, no, don't know" over 4-point Likert scale to a typical NPS-like 11-point scale.

          At the time being it wasn't feasible to build all variations. So, for the sake of simplicity and ease of implementation, we decided to go with the first option "yes, no, don't know". This was the best fit for all of our questions that we could actually implement at the time.

            image_caption: Initially I explored a more varied range of interface elements to provide answer options for each question. Deciding for the most pragmatic approach allowed us to get this feature into development quicker and get clearer responses from our users.
  - title: Two products in one
    contents:
      - heading: First concept for course & subscription
        text: |
          In addition to the core product "Digital Prevention Course", we wanted to create an offering that attracts new audiences and increases retention for existing users beyond the original course.

          I conducted a competitor anaylsis and market research of similar products to find how they approach subscriptions. I put my insights into the context of pelvina and shaped an early concept that shows how a user flow could look like when pelvina would offer a subscription alongside its course content. I point out possible challenges and potentials regarding to user experience. The concept served as a basis for discussion and further decisions.
        images:
          - image_url: pelvina_subscriptions_concept.png
            image_alt: A large flow chart diagram that shows how users would be guided through pelvina if it had the course and a subscription.
            image_caption: |
              In contrast to the pre-structured course model, freely consumbale content (similar to a typical fitness app) is offered through a subscription. Both products can be used parallel in one and the same app.
              
              On the content screen users can switch a toggle to explore the different offerings. The course as well as the subscriptions offers some free content to enable users to try out pelvina. At a certain point either subscribing or purchasing the course is mandatory to unlock further content.
