    <p>
      I'm a self-taught web designer based in Berlin. For more than 15 years I have been occupying myself with digital design and computer based creation. In that timespan I shot and retouched product photos, created flyers, posters, brochures â€” and of course websites .

      The first website I ever contributed to went live in 2001 but it took me a few years until I started to translate my designs into HTML and CSS all by myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the last couple of years I'm offering both web design and front-end development services professionally. Amongst others I helped to build websites and other digital products for clients like <em>Danone, SwissCom, myclimate, Pernod Ricard Austria, Mercedes Benz, Axel Springer SE and Berliner Sparkasse</em>.
