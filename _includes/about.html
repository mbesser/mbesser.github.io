    <p>
      I'm a self-taught web designer based in Berlin. For more than 15 years I have been occupying myself with digital design and computer based creation. I believe in design as an <em>iterative process</em> that requires <em>close collaboration</em> with all key stakeholders.
      At every stage of the process there needs to be <em>lively exchange</em> between people involved in the project.

      The first website I ever contributed to went live in 2001 but it took me a few years until I started to translate my designs into HTML and CSS all by myself. In that timespan I shot and retouched product photos, created flyers, posters, brochures â€” and of course websites.

      For the last couple of years I'm offering both web design and front-end development services professionally. Amongst others I helped to build websites and other digital products for clients like <em>Danone, SwissCom, myclimate, Pernod Ricard Austria, Mercedes Benz, Axel Springer SE and Berliner Sparkasse</em>.
