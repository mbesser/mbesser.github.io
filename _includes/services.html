            Classic website, a full-blown web application or anything in between –
            I cover all tasks needed to merge required functionality with
            pleasing aesthetics into products that are enjoyable and easy to use.

            From ideas and rough sketches to user task flows and wireframes to visual
            design and prototypes – I design web and mobile apps, emails, blogs and
            websites.

            I build front-ends specialising on the languages mentioned above.
            My first priority is to write code that is well structured,
            maintainable and easy to read and understand.

            When I'm not coding my own designs, I support teams and companies in realising
            their projects and products. Many of my past projects were Ruby on
            Rails applications, so I gained a lot experience implementing designs
            in this particular environment.
