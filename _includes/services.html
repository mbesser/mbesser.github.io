          <p>
            I am a hands-on designer with many years of experience in designing user interfaces for digital products ranging from simple websites to complex web applications and mobile apps.
          </p>
          <p>
            My experience and insights from analytics and user research are the foundation for design decisions that strengthen user experience and support the achieving of business goals. 
          </p>
          <p>
            From the idea to the finished product I work with special attention to the right details and with a strong understanding of web development. At the intersection of design, software development and product management I advocate the user perspective and mediate between the players.

            I am a design implementer who likes to work at the front-front-end of products.
            I specialise in writing HTML and CSS with a dash of JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            Work closely with software developers, I implement robust, component-based front-ends.
            I place the highest value on a pragmatic and precise implementation of the design â€“ usability, accessibility and last but not least, the designers' intention always in mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the past I implented design in various stacks, including Ruby on Rails, React and Vue.
