If you like to meet Berlin's JavaScript people, the Berlin.JS meetup is the place to be. I did the complete website design (including a logo) and implementation. The first project I mostly designed in the browser using a responsive web design approach.

[Visit the website](http://berlinjs.org)

### Update 2013: Attempt on a redesign
Berlin.JS outgrew it's original website. To meet the new requirements a redesign became necessary. I'm doing the complete redesign with a mobile first approach and i'm also building the page templates. While the site is still in development the code is open sourced on [Github](https://github.com/berlinjs/new-berlinjs.org).
