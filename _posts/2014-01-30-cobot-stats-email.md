The [Cobot](http://cobot.me) team wanted customers to stay informed about their coworking spaces' growth and business metrics.

To achieve this customers should receive a weekly email providing them with a recap of current numbers and statistics. This email works as a complement to the previously implemented [analytics section]({% post_url 2013-07-22-cobot-analytics %}). New customers get introduced to the analytics and get an incentive to make a use of the metrics provided.

My role included the design and development of an responsive email template that works in all major mail clients on a variety of devices. In close collaboration I delivered everything from early sketches and wireframes to detailed mockups and production code. I've built the template upon the [Ink](http://zurb.com/ink) framework and used [Litmus](http://litmus.com) for testing the mail in various clients.

Cobot published a [blogpost](http://blog.cobot.me/post/80063402778/weekly-status-email) announcing the new feature.
