The [Cobot](http://cobot.me) team wanted customers to stay informed about
their coworking spaces' growth and business metrics. To achieve this customers
should receive a weekly email providing them with a recap of current numbers and
statistics. This email works as a complement to the previously implemented
[analytics section]({% post_url 2013-07-22-cobot-analytics %}). It introduces
the analytics section to new customers and acts as an incentive to make a use of
the metrics provided.

My role included the design and development of an responsive email template.
In close collaboration I delivered everything from early sketches and wireframes
to detailed mockups and production code. I've built the template upon the
[Ink](http://zurb.com/ink) email framework and used [Litmus](http://litmus.com)
for testing the same in various email clients.

Cobot published a [blogpost](http://blog.cobot.me/post/80063402778/weekly-status-email)
announcing the new feature.
