Most remotes for spotify have to be controlled via native apps. Spotify-Remote is open source, platform agnostic and works with almost every modern browser.
Spotify-Remote is a project by [Coding Robin](http://coding-robin.de/2013/02/11/spotify-remote.html). I'm designing and developing the interface.
