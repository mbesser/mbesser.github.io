Berlin.JS outgrew it's original website. To meet the new requirements a redesign became necessary. I'm doing the complete redesign with a mobile first approach and i'm also building the page templates. While the site is still in development the code is open sourced on [Github](https://github.com/berlinjs/new-berlinjs.org).
