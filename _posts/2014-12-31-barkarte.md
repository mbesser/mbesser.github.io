Barkarte.at is a web application that enables pub owners to create and design high-quality bar menus in the browser, order them and get the final print product delivered at their door steps.

I handled the design process from early concepts to final implementation. Delivered user journey documentation, wireframes, mockup in several levels of fidelity, a front-end styleguide and much more.

Define user flow. Decided to split the whole process into 3 larger flows each covering an important part of data input.
