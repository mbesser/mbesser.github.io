Reject.JS is an annual, community-driven full day JavaScript conference happening in Berlin. In 2015 the event celebrates it's fifth birthday.

Reject.JS was born in 2010 out of the monthly [Berlin.JS](http://berlinjs.org) meetups, and aims to give a chance to experience the JavaScript community to rejected speakers of JSConf.eu, people who didn't get a ticket and everyone else who's interested. Nowadays, Reject.JS is a full-blown conference itself, while still staying true to its roots.

I am a team member since 2011. Since then I take care of the conference website design & implementation. From the very beginning I decided to apply a responive web design approach and sticked to it.

### Evolution of the Reject.JS website

Over the years I've done several website designs for the conference. Each year I tried something new or used freshly learned techniques while keeping the whole thing relatively simple.

    While the first Reject.JS was announced on the website of <a href="http://berlinjs.org" title="Berlin JavaScript Usergroup">Berlin.JS</a> the 2012 edition got its very own site. You can still <a href="http://2012.rejectjs.org" title="Reject.JS 2012">see it live</a>.

    In <a href="http://2013.rejectjs.org" title="Reject.JS 2013">2013</a> the conference got a freshly designed page with a new logo and main color. The new design is much clearer and more straightforward than before.

    Layout is wider and sports more whitespace paired with components that are more sophisticated than those before. The blue of previous versions is now completely gone. The <a href="http://2014.rejectjs.org" title="Reject.JS 2014">2014 Reject.JS</a> settled on that striking pink color and its variations.

    Besides the beloved pink everything is new again. <a href="http://rejectjs.org" title="Reject.JS 2015">The 2015 version</a> relies heavily on Flexbox for layout and componentsâ€”which was new for me in this extent. Another novelty is the extensive use of SVG graphics
