[Reject.JS](http://rejectjs.org) is an annual, community-driven full day JavaScript conference happening in Berlin.

Reject.JS was born in 2010 out of the monthly [Berlin.JS](http://berlinjs.org) meetups, and aims to give a chance to experience the JavaScript community to rejected speakers of JSConf.eu, people who didn't get a ticket and everyone else who's interested. Nowadays, Reject.JS is a full-blown conference itself, while still staying true to its roots.

I am a team member since 2011. Since then I take care of the conference website design & implementation. From the very beginning I decided to apply a responive webdesign approach and sticked to it.
