[Cobot](http://cobot.me) is a webapp that frees coworking space managers from
mundane tasks, giving them the time to do what is important: attending to their
coworkers. The new analytics section provides coworking space managers with
detailed insight into what is going on in their space.

I designed charts, tables and the interface which contains them. Afterwards I
created the mockups and a small prototype that shows how the new section will
integrate with the main application. Finally, I implemented the design within a
rails app which uses handlebars.js for templating.
[Alex](https://twitter.com/langalex) from the Cobot team built the charts
using D3.js.

The Cobot team wrote an elaborate
[blogpost](http://blog.cobot.me/post/55591004529/whats-the-trend-friend) about
this new set of features.
