The new analytics section provides coworking space managers with detailed insight into what is going on in their space.

I designed charts, tables and the interface which contains them. Afterwards I created the mockups and a small prototype that shows how the new section will integrate with the main application. Finally, I implemented the design within a rails app which uses handlebars.js for templating. [Alex](https://twitter.com/langalex) from the Cobot team built the charts using D3.js.

[Cobot](http://cobot.me) is a webapp that frees coworking space managers from mundane tasks, giving them the time to do what is important: attending to their coworkers. 

The Cobot team published an elaborate [blogpost](http://blog.cobot.me/post/55591004529/whats-the-trend-friend) about this new set of features.
