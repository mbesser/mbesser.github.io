        <p>
          I'm a self-taught web designer based in <del>Berlin</del> Augsburg. For more than {{ years_in_design }} years I have been occupying myself with digital design and computer based creation. I believe in design as an <em>iterative process</em> that requires <em>close collaboration</em> with all key stakeholders.
          At every stage of the process there needs to be <em>lively exchange</em> between people involved in the project.

          The first website I ever contributed to went live in 2001 but it took me a few years until I started to translate my designs into HTML and CSS all by myself. In that timespan I shot and retouched product photos, created flyers, posters, brochures â€” and of course websites.

          For the last couple of years I'm offering both web design and front-end development services professionally. Amongst others I helped to build websites and other digital products for clients like <em>Danone, SwissCom, myclimate, Pernod Ricard Austria, Mercedes Benz, Axel Springer SE and Berliner Sparkasse</em>.

          Along the way I got involved with the Berlin tech community and took part in the organization of the <a href="http://rejectjs.org">Reject.JS</a> conference and <a href="http://nodecopter.com">Nodecopter</a>. Over the years <a href="http://2014.rejectjs.org">I built</a> <a href="http://2013.rejectjs.org">a few</a> <a href="http://2012.rejectjs.org">websites</a> for Reject.JS, took lots of <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/101926979@N03/albums">photos</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gucpgJEJ5b4">shot and edited</a> a
